Improved Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithm |Python, Jupiter Notebook
•	Investigated the application of machine learning for breast cancer detection.
•	Implemented logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers on a dataset of breast biopsy samples.
•	Logistic regression achieved the highest accuracy followed by Random Forest in classifying malignant and benign cases.
•	Demonstrated the potential of machine learning in improving breast cancer detection accuracy.
•	Highlighted the need to explore feature engineering and model optimization techniques further.
